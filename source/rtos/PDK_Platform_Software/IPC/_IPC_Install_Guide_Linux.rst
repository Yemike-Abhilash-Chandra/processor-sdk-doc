Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inter/Intra Processor Communication (IPC) is a product designed to
enable communication between processors in a multi-processor
environment. Features of IPC include message passing, multi-processor
gates, shared memory primitives, and more.

IPC is designed for use with processors running SYS/BIOS applications.
This is typically an ARM or DSP. IPC includes support for High Level
Operating Systems (HLOS) like Linux, as well as the SYS/BIOS RTOS. The
breadth of IPC features supported in an HLOS environment is reduced in
an effort to simplify the product.

Install
^^^^^^^^

IPC is often distributed and installed within a larger SDK. In those
cases, no installation is required.

Outside of an SDK, `IPC can be downloaded
here <http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ipc/index.html>`__,
and is released as a zip file. To install, simply extract the file.

::

    buildhost$ unzip ipc_<version>.zip

This will extract the IPC product in a directory with its product name
and version information (e.g. **c:/ti/ipc_<version>**)

.. note::

  -  This document assumes the IPC install path to be the user's home
     directory on a Linux host machine (**/home/<user>**) or the user's
     main drive on a Windows host machine (**C:\\**). The variable
     **IPC_INSTALL_DIR** will be used throughout the document. If IPC was
     installed at a different location, make appropriate changes to
     commands.
  -  Some customers find value in archiving the released sources in a
     configuration management system. This can help in identifying any
     changes made to the original sources - often useful when updating to
     newer releases.

Build
^^^^^^^^

The IPC product often comes with prebuilt SYS/BIOS-side libraries, so
rebuilding them isn't necessary. The Linux-side user libraries may also
be provided prebuilt, but customers often want to change the
configuration (e.g. static, dynamic).

IPC provides GNU makefile(s) to rebuild all its libraries at the base of
the product, details are below.

.. note::
  GNU make version 3.81 or greater is required. The XDC tools (provided
  with most SDKs and CCS distributions) includes a pre-compiled version of
  GNU make 3.81 in $(XDC_INSTALL_DIR)/gmake.

products.mak
""""""""""""""

IPC contains a **products.mak** file at the root of the product that
specifies the necessary paths and options to build IPC for the various
OS support.

Edit **products.mak** and set the following variables:

-  Variables used by **both Linux-side and BIOS-side** build scripts

   -  **PLATFORM** - (Optional) Device to build for

      -  To find the supported list of platforms, run: **./configure
         --help**
      -  If not set, Linux libraries and executables for all supported
         platforms will be built.
      -  If not set, BIOS libraries for all toolchains specified (see
         below) will be built, but no BIOS-side executables will be
         built.

         -  BIOS-side builds started leveraging this variable in IPC
            3.10. Prior releases built BIOS-side executables for **all**
            supported platforms based on that targets/toolchains set
            above (which can take a while!)

-  Variables used by **Linux-side** build scripts

   -  **TOOLCHAIN_INSTALL_DIR** - Path to the devices ARM Linux
      cross-compiler toolchain
   -  **TOOLCHAIN_LONGNAME** - Long name of the devices toolchain (e.g.
      arm-none-linux-gnueabi)
   -  **KERNEL_INSTALL_DIR** - Location of your Linux kernel
      installation

      -  In old releases, this variable was optional, and only needed
         for platforms that support the MmRpc API (e.g. OMAP5, DRA7XX).
         In IPC 3.00.04, 3.10.02, and 3.20+, all platforms began
         requiring this variable to interrogate your kernel's version
         (via KERNEL_INSTALL_DIR/linux/version.h) and accommodate
         different kernels.

   -  **DRM_PREFIX** - (Optional) Location of your libdrm installation,
      used by some MmRpc tests

      -  This is only used by MmRpc tests, and therefore only should be
         set for platforms that support the MmRpc API
      -  If set, additional MmRpc tests may be built.

   -  **CMEM_INSTALL_DIR** - (Optional) Path to TI Linux Utils package
      to locate the pre-built
      `CMEM <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Linux_Utils_Overview>`__
      libraries used by some MessageQ tests

      -  If set, additional test applications for select platforms may
         be built.

-  Variables used by **BIOS-side** build scripts

   -  **XDC_INSTALL_DIR** - Path to TI's XDCTools installation (e.g.
      **c:/ti/xdctools_<version>**)
   -  **BIOS_INSTALL_DIR** - Path to TI's SYS/BIOS installation (e.g.
      **c:/ti/bios_<version>**)
   -  **ti.targets.<device target and file format>** - Path to TI
      toolchain for the device. (e.g.
      **c:/ti/CCS/ccsbase/tools/compiler/c6000_<version>**)

      -  Set only the variables to the targets your device supports to
         minimize build time.

.. note::
  The specific versions of dependent components can be found in the IPC
  Release Notes, provided in the product.

ipc-linux.mak
""""""""""""""""

The Linux-side build is provided as a GNU Autotools (Autoconf, Automake,
Libtool) project. If you are familiar with Autoconf GNU projects, you
can proceed with using the **./configure** script directly to
cross-compile the Linux user libraries and tests.

For those that require some assistance, the IPC package provides a GNU
makefile (**ipc-linux.mak**) to configure the Linux-side build, using
the options and component paths set in the **products.mak** file. To
configure the build using these files, issue the following command:

::

    <buildhost> make -f ipc-linux.mak config

There are few additional target goals provided in the ipc-linux.mak file
for commonly used configurations. These goals include:

-  config - (Default) Configure both static and shared (dynamic) Linux
   IPC user libraries. Executables (e.g. lad and tests) link against the
   shared libraries.
-  config-static - Configure static only libraries and executables.
-  config-shared - Configure shared (dynamic) only libraries and
   executables.

Once the 'config' is complete, and the autotools-generated Makefile has
been created, you can build the Linux side of IPC by issuing the
following:

::

    <buildhost> make

You can also specify a PLATFORM to (re)configure for on the command line
which overrides any options set in the products.mak file as follows:

::

      <buildhost> make -f ipc-linux.mak config PLATFORM=omapl138
      <buildhost> make

Note that before reconfiguring for a new Linux toolchain or platform,
the autotools-generated files should be clean(ed):

::

      <buildhost> make distclean

|

ipc-bios.mak
""""""""""""""

The SYS/BIOS-side IPC is built with a GNU makefile. After editing
**products.mak**, issue the following command:

::

    <buildhost> make -f ipc-bios.mak all

Based on the number of targets you're building for, this may take some
time.

.. note::
  The BIOS-side libraries often come pre-built, so in many cases,
  rebuilding the BIOS-side is not necessary. Some reasons you may want to
  rebuild:

-  Your distribution of IPC **didn't** come with the necessary pre-built
   libraries
-  You intend to run the 'test' executables (which often don't come
   pre-built)
-  You want to use a specific toolchain or dependency version
-  You want to tune some of the compile options

Run
^^^^^

The IPC product provides a way to install (copy) the necessary IPC
executables and libraries onto the device's target file-system to
simplify the execution of the applications.

Configuring Kernel
"""""""""""""""""""

The IPC product provides a set of Linux kernel patches that need to be
applied to the different device supported kernels to add necessary
kernel support. The patches are located in the linux/patches directory
of the IPC installation.

OMAP-L138
''''''''''

The kernel for the OMAP-L138, can be obtained from `Gitorious
linux-davinci project <http://gitorious.org/linux-davinci>`__.

The patches apply to the following commit id:
**595ab716fc6e648b7dc79a58a01917ebb67b9508**

The specific patches needed for this kernel can be found in the
**linux/patches/3.8.0** of your IPC installation.

Once the patches are applied, there are a few key config parameters
needed for rpmsg and socket driver to build/work.

CONFIG_REMOTEPROC=m
CONFIG_DA8XX_REMOTEPROC=m
CONFIG_RPMSG=m
CONFIG_VIRTIO=m
It is also recommended to compile a Linux kernel with the debugfs
facility

CONFIG_DEBUG_FS=y
Re-build the kernel. For example:

::

    buildhost$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-  uImage

You will also need to re-build the kernel modules and install them on
your target's file system. For example:

::

    buildhost$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-  modules
    buildhost$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- INSTALL_MOD_PATH=<target filesystem> modules_install

Kernel Boot-up Parameters
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

IPC requires an argument to be passed to the Linux kernel during boot up
to properly run the tests. The remote processor(s) (rproc) memory
location needs to be set.

-  For example,

::

    bootargs console=ttyS2,115200n8 root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=HOST:nfs_root,nolock rw ip=dhcp rproc_mem=16M@0xC3000000

*This is just an example, bootargs may vary depending on available setup*
Depending on the memory map used in the final system configuration,
the memory to be reserved for rproc usage may differ.

Installing Tests
""""""""""""""""""

To assemble the IPC test executables and libraries into a directory
structure suitable for running on the target's file-system, issue the
following command in the IPC install directory:

::

    buildhost$ make install prefix=<target filesystem>/usr

*Depending on you target's filesystem directory privileges, you may be
required to run **sudo make install** to properly install the files
*

.. note::
  The test executables and libraries will be installed in the location
  path set by the **prefix** variable. If you are installing directly on a
  host mounted Network Filesystem(NFS), make sure to specify **usr** at
  the end of the **prefix** variable path. As with other variables, you
  can override this on the command line:
  ::

    buildhost$ sudo make install prefix=<target filesystem>/usr

|

The remote processor's applications will be loaded via the remote_proc
kernel module but they need to reside on the devices target filesystem
in **/lib/firmware** directory. The location of the remote core
application within the IPC product various based on device.

Slave Binaries
''''''''''''''''

The slave-side test binaries, once built, are found in your
IPC_INSTALL_DIR/packages/ti/ipc/tests/bin/<platform>_<core> directory.

Copy the appropriate slave-side executable onto the devices target
filesystem into the **/lib/firmware** directory. For example, OMAP-L138
developers would do this:

::

    buildhost$ cp IPC_INSTALL_DIR/packages/ti/ipc/tests/bin/ti_platforms_evmOMAPL138_DSP/ <target filesystem>/lib/firmware/.

IPC Daemons and Drivers
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

IPC provides system-wide services across multiple applications, and
utilizes low-level system hardware (e.g. interrupts and shared memory).
To facilitate these services, IPC uses a user-space daemon (LAD) and
several kernel device drivers.

.. rubric:: LAD
   :name: lad

System-wide IPC state is managed by a user-space daemon (LAD). This
daemon is specific to a given device, and is named lad_<device>. It will
reside on the target's filesystem (typically in /usr/bin/) after
following the `#Installing Tests <index_Foundational_Components.html#installing-tests>`__ section. To run
LAD, execute:

::

    target# /usr/bin/lad_<device>

This forks the LAD daemon and leaves it running in the background.

LAD takes an optional argument to indicate a filename into which log
statements should be emitted. This file will be created in the
**/tmp/LAD/** directory. How to specify the filename varies based on
your IPC release. For example, to instruct LAD to emit log statements
into a 'lad.txt' file, start LAD like this:

-  Releases before IPC 3.21:

::

    target# /usr/bin/lad_<device> lad.txt

-  IPC 3.21 and after:

::

    target# /usr/bin/lad_<device> -l lad.txt

|

.. rubric:: Drivers
   :name: drivers

The kernel drivers/modules added by the Linux patches must be inserted
into the kernel for IPC applications to run correctly. Refer to the
`#Configuring Kernel <index_Foundational_Components.html#configuring-kernel>`__ section. The required
modules must be configured, built and loaded onto the target's
filesystem.

Prior to loading the modules, a directory (/debug) must be created at
the root of your devices filesystem. This directory will be mounted as a
debugfs (debug filesystem) which the kernel modules will use to provide
details about the slaves (e.g. running state, trace output, etc). If the
/debug directory doesn't exist, simply create it as follows:

::

    target# mkdir /debug

.. rubric:: OMAP-L138
   :name: omap-l138-1

On OMAP-L138, the kernel modules can be loaded with the following
command on the target's file-system:

::

    target# depmod -a
    target# mount -t debugfs none /debug
    target# modprobe remoteproc
    target# modprobe da8xx_remoteproc da8xx_fw_name=messageq_single.xe674
    target# modprobe virtio_rpmsg_bus
    target# modprobe rpmsg_proto

The kernel modules can be unloaded by issuing the following command on
the target's file-system:

::

    target# umount /debug
    target# rmmod rpmsg_proto
    target# rmmod virtio_rpmsg_bus
    target# rmmod da8xx_remoteproc
    target# rmmod remoteproc

.. rubric:: OMAP54XX
   :name: omap54xx

On OMAP54XX, the kernel modules can be loaded with the following command
on the target's file-system:

::

    target# depmod -a
    target# mount -t debugfs none /debug
    target# modprobe remoteproc
    target# modprobe omap_remoteproc
    target# modprobe virtio_rpmsg_bus
    target# modprobe rpmsg_proto

Running Test Applications
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The test applications are already on the target's filesystem in /usr/bin
assuming the `#Installing Tests <index_Foundational_Components.html#installing-tests>`__ section has been
followed.

To run the test application's, execute the following on the target's
filesystem:

::

    target# /usr/bin/MessageQApp_<device>

.. rubric:: OMAP-L138
   :name: omap-l138-2

The expected output on the Linux-side should be:

::

    Using numLoops: 100; procId : 1
    Entered MessageQApp_execute
    Local MessageQId: 0x1
    Remote queueId  [0x10000]
    Exchanging 100 messages with remote processor DSP...
    MessageQ_get #0 Msg = 0x15328
    Exchanged 1 messages with remote processor DSP
    MessageQ_get #1 Msg = 0x15328
    ...
    ...
    Exchanged 99 messages with remote processor DSP
    MessageQ_get #99 Msg = 0x15328
    Exchanged 100 messages with remote processor DSP
    Sample application successfully completed!
    Leaving MessageQApp_execute

The output on the remote processor, can be obtained by running the
following on the target filesystem:

::

    target# cat /debug/remoteproc/remoteproc0/trace0

The expected output on the remote processor should be:

::
